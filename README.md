# Personal Portfolio Website

## Used Technologies

This website was build using React.js as the frontend framework with the help of Material UI library.

## Introduction

Hi there, I'm Philip
I'm a self-taught Full-stack Engineer currently based in Cheb, Czech Republic.

## About Me

HEY THERE,

My name is Philip Tran.
I express my creativity through code.
I'm a self-taught full-stack engineer who is passionate about creating extraordinary things. Currently based in Cheb, Czech Republic.

Code has always been a way for me to express my creativity and I strongly believe that this passion will stay with me in the future as well.

Apart from coding I also enjoy writting poetry, even though I will be probably forever locked in my drawer, or wondering about various start-up ideas.

To be frank, I believe that a great mind needs a healthy body. Thus gyms or basketball courts are basicly my second home.

Among my other activities I would mention researching cryptocurrencies, stocks and finance in general.
